## 1. Introduction
This custom desktop PC build represents an **AMD-based extreme-entry level gaming** system designed for enthusiasts who want premium performance without compromise. Built around the cutting-edge AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D processor and MSI GeForce RTX 5080 graphics card, this configuration delivers excellent 4K gaming performance while maintaining high frame rates in most modern AAA titles. The system features top-tier components including 64GB of DDR5-6000 RAM, PCIe 5.0 NVMe storage, and liquid cooling to ensure optimal performance even under heavy workloads.


With a budget of approximately ₱210,000, this build embodies the philosophy of "To be wealthy! Nearly every option in this tier is 'best-in-class', and is priced to match." While this represents a significant investment that borders on fanaticism, each component has been carefully selected to provide smooth gaming experiences and future-proofing for years to come. This extreme-entry level approach ensures that users won't need to upgrade individual components for several years; nonetheless, the PC still has ample room for upgrades should one choose to enhance its performance further in the future, making it a sound long-term investment for serious gaming enthusiasts.

## 4. Compatibility Justification
- **CPU + Motherboard**: The AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D (AM5, LGA1718) works perfectly with the MSI MPG X870E CARBON WIFI. The board’s AM5 socket and X870E chipset fully support the chip, and its dual 8-pin EPS connectors handle the CPU’s 120W TDP with room for boosting for stable performance.

- **CPU Cooler**: The MSI MPG CORELIQUID K240 includes the proper AM5 bracket for an easy mount. Its 240mm radiator (275×120×27mm) fits at the front of the case and keeps the CPU under control during heavy gaming sessions.

- **RAM**: The Corsair Vengeance RGB 64GB DDR5-6000 uses 2 of the 4 DIMM slots. With EXPO enabled, it runs at 6000 MHz, giving faster memory speeds that help with gaming and multitasking.

- **Storage 1 (SSD)**: The Samsung 990 EVO Plus 4TB NVMe installs in one of the Lightning Gen5 M.2 slots. In this setup, it runs at PCIe 5.0 x2, providing quick load times and responsiveness suitable for gaming.

- **Storage 2 (HDD)**: The Toshiba N300 4TB hooks up over SATA III 6Gb/s, which the board fully supports. Its 3.5" form factor slides into the case bays without issue and provides a solid amount of extra storage for a large game library.

- **Graphics Card**: The MSI RTX 5080 16GB makes full use of the PCIe 5.0 x16 slot. At 288mm long, it clears the case’s 300 limit comfortably. The Ryzen 7 9800X3D keeps up with it, so no CPU bottlenecks, and the PSU provides the proper ATX 3.1 connectors.

- **Power Supply**: The Asus ROG Strix 1000W has nearly 50% headroom over the system’s ~672W draw. Its ATX 3.1 design means it has all the right connectors, including native support for the RTX 5080.

- **Case**: The MSI MAG VAMPIRIC 100R mid-tower supports ATX boards (305×244mm) with the correct mounts. It leaves 300mm of space for the GPU and room up front for a 240mm radiator, so cooling is easy to set up.

- **Case Fans**: The Corsair iCUE LINK LX120 RGB 3-pack fits the standard 120mm mounts. With PWM control, airflow can be tuned easily to keep temps steady during long gaming sessions.

## 5. Budget Analysis
- **Budget Limit**: ₱200,000.00 with 5% (or more) flexibility
- **Final Total**: ₱209,953.00
- Within budget ✅
### Trade-offs
- **Power Supply Downgrade Consideration**: Although we selected the ASUS ROG Strix 1000W 80+ Platinum PSU (₱14,450.00), a more budget-friendly alternative would be the A850GL PCIe 5.0 850W 80+ Gold at ₱8,695.00 [DataBlitz](https://ecommerce.datablitz.com.ph/products/msi-mag-a850gl-pcie5-0-850w-80-gold-gen-5-atx-3-0-full-modular-power-supply). This would save ₱5,755.00 while still providing adequate power (850W vs. estimated 672W draw = 26% headroom). However, we chose the 1000W Platinum unit for:
    - Greater power headroom (~50% vs. 26%) for future upgrades
    - Higher efficiency (Platinum vs. Gold) reducing long-term electricity costs
    - Better component longevity when PSU operates at lower load percentages
    - We had the budget for it, so why not get the better component
- **RAM Price Volatility**: The Corsair Vengeance RGB 64GB kit was priced at ₱15,595.00 when we selected it on September 26, 2025 ([Link to Screenshots](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KzhMvCtYWySRYEeg5Q7X0_3ui6HHbwL0?usp=drive_link)). By October 3, 2025, the price increased to ₱15,925.00. Between these dates, prices temporarily spiked to approximately ₱19,000.00 (22% increase). This ₱3,405.00 swing shows the volatile nature of PC component pricing in the Philippine market and the importance of acting quickly when good prices appear.

## 6. Conclusion & Learnings
### Price Comparison: International vs. Local Market
The PCPartPicker build totaled $3,318.57 USD (₱192,131.93 PHP equivalent), appearing ₱17,821.07 cheaper than our Manila vendor total of ₱209,953.00. However, when attempting to purchase directly from Amazon using the PCPartPicker list, import charges reached approximately $450 USD (~₱26,000 PHP), bringing the actual international purchase total to around ₱218,000—making it more expensive than sourcing locally. So, while US retail prices appear lower, import duties, shipping costs, and handling fees make local sourcing more cost-effective for Philippine buyers, despite the retail markup on individual components.

### Challenges Encountered
- **Component Availability**: Finding exact PCPartPicker models locally was challenging. Some components initially picked were out of stock or not yet available in the Philippines so we then had to edit the parts in PCPartPicker to check for compatibility and check from local vendors again if they had the alternative available.
- **Price Volatility**: Component prices fluctuated significantly during our planning period. The RAM price swing from ₱15,595 to ₱19,000 showed how quickly prices can change, making timing important for staying within budget.
- **Different Vendors**: We had to source parts from four different vendors (DataBlitz, VillMan, PC Express, EasyPC), making price comparison more time-consuming as they often differed in prices.

### What We Learned
- **Technical Knowledge**: We learned about component compatibility (sockets, chipsets, physical clearances), power requirements with PSU efficiency ratings, and thermal management. Some group members had prior knowledge which also helped the team understand these concepts better.
- **System Design**: The high budget assigned to our group actually taught us how much better, both in performance and longevity, a good budget can provide. At the same time, it taught us how to still be selective with components as we can't just pick all the most expensive parts and call it a day; we also had to check the compatibility between the parts.
- **Practical Skills**: We learned that the Philippine PC market lags behind US availability, and import charges make international purchases more expensive than local sourcing despite lower retail prices. The project also trained us in cross-referencing specifications between models and prices across vendors, helping us get the better options available.
