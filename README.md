## 1. Introduction
This custom desktop PC build represents an **AMD-based extreme-entry level gaming** system designed for enthusiasts who want premium performance without compromise. Built around the cutting-edge AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D processor and MSI GeForce RTX 5080 graphics card, this configuration delivers excellent 4K gaming performance while maintaining high frame rates in most modern AAA titles. The system features top-tier components including 64GB of DDR5-6000 RAM, PCIe 5.0 NVMe storage, and liquid cooling to ensure optimal performance even under heavy workloads.


With a budget of approximately ₱210,000, this build embodies the philosophy of "To be wealthy! Nearly every option in this tier is 'best-in-class', and is priced to match." While this represents a significant investment that borders on fanaticism, each component has been carefully selected to provide smooth gaming experiences and future-proofing for years to come. This extreme-entry level approach ensures that users won't need to upgrade individual components for several years; nonetheless, the PC still has ample room for upgrades should one choose to enhance its performance further in the future, making it a sound long-term investment for serious gaming enthusiasts.

## 4. Compatibility Justification
- **CPU + Motherboard**: The AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D (AM5, LGA1718) works perfectly with the MSI MPG X870E CARBON WIFI. The board’s AM5 socket and X870E chipset fully support the chip, and its dual 8-pin EPS connectors handle the CPU’s 120W TDP with room for boosting for stable performance.

- **CPU Cooler**: The MSI MPG CORELIQUID K240 includes the proper AM5 bracket for an easy mount. Its 240mm radiator (275×120×27mm) fits at the front of the case and keeps the CPU under control during heavy gaming sessions.

- **RAM**: The Corsair Vengeance RGB 64GB DDR5-6000 uses 2 of the 4 DIMM slots. With EXPO enabled, it runs at 6000 MHz, giving faster memory speeds that help with gaming and multitasking.

- **Storage 1 (SSD)**: The Samsung 990 EVO Plus 4TB NVMe installs in one of the Lightning Gen5 M.2 slots. In this setup, it runs at PCIe 5.0 x2, providing quick load times and responsiveness suitable for gaming.

- **Storage 2 (HDD)**: The Toshiba N300 4TB hooks up over SATA III 6Gb/s, which the board fully supports. Its 3.5" form factor slides into the case bays without issue and provides a solid amount of extra storage for a large game library.

- **Graphics Card**: The MSI RTX 5080 16GB makes full use of the PCIe 5.0 x16 slot. At 288mm long, it clears the case’s 300 limit comfortably. The Ryzen 7 9800X3D keeps up with it, so no CPU bottlenecks, and the PSU provides the proper ATX 3.1 connectors.

- **Power Supply**: The Asus ROG Strix 1000W has nearly 50% headroom over the system’s ~672W draw. Its ATX 3.1 design means it has all the right connectors, including native support for the RTX 5080.

- **Case**: The MSI MAG VAMPIRIC 100R mid-tower supports ATX boards (305×244mm) with the correct mounts. It leaves 300mm of space for the GPU and room up front for a 240mm radiator, so cooling is easy to set up.

- **Case Fans**: The Corsair iCUE LINK LX120 RGB 3-pack fits the standard 120mm mounts. With PWM control, airflow can be tuned easily to keep temps steady during long gaming sessions.

## 5. Budget Analysis
- **Budget Limit**: ₱210,000.00
- **Final Total**: ₱209,953.00
- Within budget ✅
- Notes on trade-offs (e.g., cheaper RAM, higher PSU wattage, no aftermarket
cooler, etc.).

## 6. Conclusion & Learnings
Initially, there exists an assumption that sourcing computer components locally would be more cost-effective in comparison to purchasing components internationally. However, contrary to expectations, the build that uses components from local Manila vendors turns out to be more expensive (~20,000.00 Php more) when compared to the build sourced from international retailers.
